# AnuPpuccin
Personal theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) :3
![](preview.png)

## Features

### Custom palette
The theme supports various palettes (5 in the base theme and even more if you use the [extended colorschemes](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin) snippet) which include many popular colorschemes such as Catppuccin and Dracula. These are heavily integrated into the theme as they are directly used to stylize various UI elements.

### Rainbow folders
The theme comes with a toggleable rainbow folder snippet which color-codes your folders as per their order in the filesystem.<br>
It's great if you need to easily distinguish between folders or if you want to make your vault look a bit prettier (Both in my case :P)<br>

#### Full rainbow theme
This snippet makes the rainbow theme apply to the first layer of the root directory, aka only direct children.<br>
You can choose if it applies to root files as well and customise the indentation border color.<br>

#### Simple rainbow theme
This snippet makes the rainbow theme apply to every folder in your filesystem, and the order is determined by the children's place in the parent folder.<br>
You can toggle if the recolor applies to the title, the collapse border, the collapse icon and you can append a small icon to the folder title as well.<br>

### Callouts
The theme comes with a custom callout style (which can be toggled so it doesn't interfere with your own callout snippet).<br>
The snippet also includes support for using the colors of your selected palette which means that the callouts don't ever look out of place :)<br>
If you use the admonition plugin/have custom callout colors, they won't be affected by the recolor as it only targets vanilla callouts. However, you can make them use AnuPpuccin's palette to support dynamic per-palette theming.<br>

## Colorschemes used
- Ros√© Pine light
- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) Latte, Frappe, Macchiato, Mocha

### If you like my theme:
I've made this theme primarily for my own purposes and it's completely free, but if you do like it enough to consider throwing a few coins in my hat, here's a ko-fi link.
